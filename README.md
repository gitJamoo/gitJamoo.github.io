Portfolio app

Ideas:

- Give pictures of me to use
- Add a factual part, designed by me
- Make it more creative!
- Add a disclaimer about what wormhole is, fun things to try, and other
- Add Resume / CV portion and then factual portion, have these buttonts be just outlines and not full block like wormhole
- Allow for other providers to be used (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc...)

Excellent, now make a new system. Have it so that users can pick from a list of three providers (Gemini, │
│ Anthropic, or OpenAI). Depending on that dropdown, they now have a option to pick which model to use (Gemini has │
│ 2.5-flash, 2.5-flash-lite, and 1.5-flash). As for the other providers, have a coming soon Option. At the end of │
│ the line, since all of these dropdowns should be on the same line, add an API key option. DO NOT HARDCODE PICKING │
│ GEMINI. Please also make it so that the wormhole can be entered from this page after configuration.
