Portfolio app

Ideas:

- Give pictures of me to use
- Add a factual part, designed by me
- Make it more creative!
- Add a disclaimer about what wormhole is, fun things to try, and other
- Add Resume / CV portion and then factual portion, have these buttonts be just outlines and not full block like wormhole
- Allow for other providers to be used (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc...)

TODO:

Add pictures for experiences
Add more projects

- i.e. add the wormhole as a project
  Add pictures TO projects
  Add links to projects
  Add navigation? Maybe a navbar or something
  Add support for multiple providers / models
